SCENRIO FILE CHANGES
====================
Two scenarios both labelled as 2.2 in previous version
- Base file format (AL set in lens calculation)
- Base file format (K value overridden)

The first of these is still 2.2, the second I have renumbered as 2.7


DICOM FILE CHANGE
=================
DICOM file ...930030.dcm was incorrectr - it had "M" for patient sex when it should have been "F". This prevented the file from importing and has been corrected


NEW TEST SCENARIO, DICOM FILE AND IMAGES
=========================================
New test scenario 1.15, Base file format (Holladay 2 formula) using patient 1009409 and DICOM file ...750047.dcm
